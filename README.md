## What i have learnt By working on this project
1. I had improved in `flex` properties
2. Got a good understanding on createing big one pager website's
3. I was stuck while designing the cards for the blog's but after a short brake I could tackle the solution by analysing the html code once again and aplying flex

## Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 1hr 23min approximately as i was not tracking the time this project was a bit tougher for me from the other ones as it forced me to know how to select siblings without class, attribute or id selector
